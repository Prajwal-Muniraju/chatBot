# **ChatBot: CDP Support**

A fully functional chatbot built using React, designed to assist with customer queries related to CDP platforms like Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot uses NLP for better query understanding and integrates with a backend to fetch responses dynamically.

## **Features**
- **Predefined Questions**: Users can select from a set of predefined questions for quick interaction.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The bot uses NLP to analyze user queries and determine the relevant CDP platform.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Fetches responses dynamically from a backend server based on the identified platform.
- **Chat History**: Keeps track of the conversation history for both the user and the bot.
- **Error Handling**: Provides error messages if the query is unrecognized or the backend fails.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive UI with an easy-to-use text input and send button.

## **Tech Stack**
